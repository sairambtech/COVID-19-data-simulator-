This project generates and visualizes synthetic COVID-19 data for research and testing.
🦠 COVID-19 Data Simulator and Analysis

📘 Overview

This project focuses on simulating and analyzing COVID-19 data to understand infection trends and recovery patterns.
It demonstrates the use of Python, NumPy, and Pandas for data creation and analysis, and applies machine learning models to predict future case trends.

⸻

🎯 Objectives
	•	Create a synthetic COVID-19 dataset with realistic case, recovery, and death statistics.
	•	Perform data analysis and visualization to identify trends over time.
	•	Build a machine learning model to predict future case counts.
	•	Present the results through clear and meaningful graphs.

⸻

⚙️ Workflow
	1.	Data Simulation:
	•	Generated a custom dataset with daily case numbers, recoveries, and deaths.
	•	Added random variation to simulate real-world pandemic behavior.
	2.	Data Preprocessing:
	•	Handled missing data and ensured balanced time-series records.
	•	Normalized features for consistent model training.
	3.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
	•	Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize daily trends, growth rate, and recovery percentage.
	•	Created heatmaps and line plots to show infection rise and recovery correlation.
	4.	Machine Learning Model:
	•	Implemented a Random Forest Regressor to predict future case counts.
	•	Evaluated performance using metrics like R² score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
	5.	Visualization:
	•	Displayed predictions versus actual data through trend graphs.
	•	Highlighted forecast accuracy and growth trends.
